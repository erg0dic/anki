# Curated Excerpts from Meditations by Marcus Aurelius (the stoic philospher emperor of Rome circa 150 AD)
## (On bearing calamity like someone who makes their own good fortune)
Paraphrase 1:
> Remember too on every occasion that leads you to vexation, to apply this principle: 
> "Not that this is a misfortune, but that to bear it nobly is good fortune"

## (On travelling the maze of problems, paths and life)
Paraphrase 2:
> Always run the shortest way. For the shortest way is the most natural one. Always say and do everthing
> in conformity with the soundest reason for such a trouble frees a man from trouble and warfare and all
> artifice and ostentatious display.

## (On rising up in the morning when it is hard and a struggle)
Paraphrase 3:
> In the morning when you feel unwilling to rise, let this thought be present. I am rising to the work of a human being.
> Why then am I so dissatisfied to do the work for which I exist? For which I have been brought into the world. 
> Or have been made for this? To stay in the bed and keep myself warm? Do you exist for the sake of pleasure 
> rather than action or exertion? Do you not see the little plants, the bees, the animals, to put into order their 
> little corners the universe?
> So why are you unwilling to do the work of a human being? To do the things that which your very nature to do?
> It is necessary to take rest but nature has set bounds for these things like it has set bounds for eating and drinking.
> Yet you go astray of these bounds constantly through your actions.
> .
> .
> . All this goes to show that you do not love yourself. Because if you did, you would love nature and accept its ways.

## (On the perseverence and tenacity of the soul)
Paraphrase 4:
> Death is a relief from sense impressions. From the pulling of the strings that move the appetites. From the discursive
> movements of the thoughts and from service of the flesh. It is shameful for the soul to be first to give way in life.
> When your body has not given way. Care that you are made into a Caeser that succumbs to this affliction. That you are not
> dyed with this dye.

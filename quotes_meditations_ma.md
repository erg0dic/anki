# Curated Excerpts from Meditations by Marcus Aurelius (the stoic philospher emperor of Rome circa 150 AD)

## (On bearing calamity like someone who makes their own good fortune)
Paraphrase 1:
> Remember too on every occasion that leads you to vexation, to apply this principle: 
> "Not that this is a misfortune, but that to bear it nobly is good fortune"

## (On travelling the maze of problems, paths and life)
Paraphrase 2:
> Always run the shortest way. For the shortest way is the most natural one. Always say and do everthing
> in conformity with the soundest reason for such a trouble frees a man from trouble and warfare and all
> artifice and ostentatious display.

## (On rising up in the morning when it is hard and a struggle)
Paraphrase 3:
> In the morning when you feel unwilling to rise, let this thought be present. I am rising to the work of a human being.
> Why then am I so dissatisfied to do the work for which I exist? For which I have been brought into the world. 
> Or have been made for this? To stay in the bed and keep myself warm? Do you exist for the sake of pleasure 
> rather than action or exertion? Do you not see the little plants, the bees, the animals, to put into order their 
> little corners the universe?
> So why are you unwilling to do the work of a human being? To do the things that which your very nature to do?
> It is necessary to take rest but nature has set bounds for these things like it has set bounds for eating and drinking.
> Yet you go astray of these bounds constantly through your actions.
> .
> .
> . All this goes to show that you do not love yourself. Because if you did, you would love nature and accept its ways.

## (On the perseverence and tenacity of the soul)
Paraphrase 4:
> Death is a relief from sense impressions. From the pulling of the strings that move the appetites. From the discursive
> movements of the thoughts and from service of the flesh. It is shameful for the soul to be first to give way in life.
> When your body has not given way. Care that you are made into a Caeser that succumbs to this affliction. That you are not
> dyed with this dye.

## (On distraction recovery)
Paraphrase 5:
> When circumstances drive you into some kind of disturbed state. Quickly return to yourself and do not continue out of tune
> longer than the compulsion lasts. For you will have more mastery over the harmony by continually recurring to it.
> .... not to be pulled about by desires like puppets on a string.

## (On sniffing out superficial falsehood/adulation)
Paraphrase 6:
> (... need to strip things of all the words with which they are exultated) For outward show is the most wonderful perverter
> of the *reason*. And when you are sure that you are most employed about the things that are worth doing. It is then that
> it cheats you most.... Most of the things that the multitudes admire are objects of the most general kind held together by
> some sort of cohesion e.g. natural organizations like vines, or fig trees. Those that are admired by men who are a little
> more reasonable are things that are held together by some living principle as flocks of birds. Those that are admired by men
>  that are still more instructed are things that are held together by a rational soul. Not a universal soul but a rational soul 
>  that is skilled in some art or expert in some other way. But one who values the rational nature of the soul, a soul fitted for
>  political life regards nothing else except this. And above all things, he keeps his soul in a condition and in an activity 
>  conformable to reason and political life  and cooperates with others who exist in this with him in cohesion.

## (On inner tranquility and envy/resentment of others)
Paraphrase 7:
> What then is to be valued? Not clapping of hands or tongues (praise from others). Suppose that you have given up this worthless
> thing called fame. What remains of value? It is in my opinion to move or to restrain yourself in conformity to your own constitution. 
> For in the end, this is where all employments or arts lead. For all art aims at this: that the thing that which is made should be
> adapted for which it has been made. For both the wine planter looks after the wine and the horse breeder and he who trains dogs seek this end. And what should
> be the aim of the education of the youth? So if this sense of true value has been established, you will not seek anything else. You will cease
> valuing a mass of other things as well. The alternative is not to be free nor sufficient in your own happiness or dispassionate. You will need
> to be envious and suspicious of others -- those who are capable of taking these things from you and plot against those who have that which you
> desire. Of necessity, man must be ever in a state of perturbation who ever needs these things. Besides which, he must also find fault with the gods. 
> But to reverence and honour your own mind will make you content and in harmony with society and in agreement with the gods. Praising all the order
> that have created...
 
## (On feeling about things not in your control)
Paraphrase 8:
> Whatever you should suppose to be good or evil in the things that are not in your control. It mustn't of necessity be that the bad thing 
> before you or the loss of a good thing that you blame the gods or hate men too who are the cause of this loss or suspected to be the cause of 
> this loss. And indeed we do much injustice in our need to make such links. But if we judge things, those that are within our power to be good
> or bad: there should be no reason to find fault with the gods or putting up a hostile attiude towards a man. 

## (On true good)
Paraphrase 9:
> What is your own good? He who loves fame considers his good to lie in another man's reactions. He who loves pleasure considers his good to lie his
> sensations. But he who has understanding considers his own acts to be his own good. It is in our power to have no opinions about things and not be
> disturbed in our souls. For things in themselves do not have the power to enter into our judgement. 

## (On universal goodness)
Paraphrase 10:
> That which is not good for the swarm, neither is it good for the bee... 

## (On recovering in life)
Paraphrase 11:
> To recover life, you must look at things like what you used to look at them before. 
> Every man is just as worth that with which he busies himself.

## (On unashamedly asking for help)
Paraphrase 12:
> Be not ashamed to be helped. For it is your job to do your duty like a soldier when there is an assault on the town. How then, 
> if being lame you cannot mount up on the battlements by yourself but with the help of another, it is possible.

## (On not letting the future disturb you)
Paraphrase 13:
> Do not let future things disturb you. For you will come to them, if it will be necessary. Having with you same reasons that which you
> have at present.

## (On natural reasons)
Paraphrase 14:
> To the rational animal, an act that is according to nature is also an act according to reason. 
> Be upright or be made upright.

## (On truly loving humanity)
Paraphrase 15:
> Just as it is with members of an organic or physical body, united in a single entity, so it is with rational beings that exist separately
> but have been brought together in a unified endeavour and the perception of this will be more apparent to you if you regularly say to
> yourself: "I am a member of a  single sysetm that is rational humanity." Do not say part for that shows that you do not love humanity from your heart. 
> Beneficience does not yet delight you for its own sake. You still do it for the sake of duty. And not out of a concern for your own true welfare.

## (On tolerable pain)
Paraphrase 16:
> The pain which is intolerable carries us off. But the pain that lasts a long time is tolerable. And the mind maintains its own tranquility by retiring
> into itself. And the ruling faculty (thinking ability, your reasoning mind) is not itself damaged by pain. As for the parts which are harmed by pain, 
> let them offer their opinion if they can. 

## (On tolerable pain 2)
Paraphrase 17:
> For every pain, always note that there is no dishonor in it. Nor does it make the governing intelligence worse. 
> Nor damage the intelligence, in either so > far as intelligence is rational nor so far as it is social. Indeed, 
> in case of most pains, let this remark of Epicurus aid you: "*No pain is intolerable and everlasting if you 
> bear in mind that it must have its limits and if you add nothing to it by your imagination. And remember this too, 
> there are many things that we do not perceive as pain even though they are disagreeable to us. Being too hot, hungry 
> etc. When you are disconcerted pain, say to yourself that your courage is failing you. You are yielding to pain.*"

## (On loving humanity 2)
Paraphrase 18:
> No soul, the philosopher says, is deprived of the truth voluntarily. Consequently, it is only in the same way that 
> it is deprived of justice, temperance > and benevolence and everything of the kind. It is most necessary to bear 
> this in mind, for thus you will be most gentle to all.

## (On loving humanity 3)
Paraphrase 19:
> Note that you do not project the same evil onto others that they project onto others out of resentment.

## (On envy/resentment 2)
Paraphrase 20:
> Whatever the rational or the social facult finds to be neither intelligent or social, it correctly judges
> that as inferior to itself.

## (On inner tranquility 2)
Paraphrase 21:
> No man is ever tired to doing something useful. But it is useful to act according to nature. Do not then be 
> tired acting according to nature. You gain that which is useful while it is also useful to others. 
> The nature of the universe resolved to create itself and the world around it. Now either the new things come
> by place or consequence of continuity or even the chief things that the ruling power of the universe directs 
> its own movements by no rational principle. If this is remembered, it will make you most tranquil in many things.

## (Advice from Plato: on viewing things from a higher place)
Paraphrase 22:
> He who is discoursing about men should also look closely at earthly things as viewed from some higher place.
> ... Armies, agriculture, marriages, treaties, deserted places, courts of justice, barbarians, feasts, lamentations, 
> markets. And see how all these form an orderly combination of countries. Consider the past. Such great changes of political 
> supremacies, you can forsee also other things, for they will be of like form. And it is not possible that they should
> deviate from the order of ways things take place now. To have contemplated human life for 40 years is the same as contemplating
> human life for 10,000 years. What will you see?

## (On the zen of Stoicism)
Paraphrase 23:
> The breeze which heaven has sent, we must endure and toil without complaint.

## (On ruling principles for the self)
Paraphrase 24:
> Do not look around you to discover other men's ruling principles. Look straight to this: to what nature leads you.
> Both the universal nature through the things that happen to you. And your own nature through the acts that must
> be done by you. Every being ought to that its own constitution. And all other things are constituted for the sake 
> of rational beings. And among the irrational things, the inferior are made for the superior. But rational things are created 
> for the sake of one another. 
> 1. The prime principle, then, in man's constitution is "social". 
> 
> 2. And second is not to yield to the persuasion
> of the body. For it is in the peculiar office of the rational mind to circumsribe **itself**. And never to be overpowered
> by the motions of the senses or the appetite of the flesh. And the intelligent motion claims superioritiy and does not allow
> itself to be overpowered by others. And for good reason, for it is formed by nature to use all of them. 
> 
> 3. And the third thing is freedom from error and deception. Let then the ruling principle go straight on its own, 
> holding fast to these things and it has what is its own.

## (On passing judgement and perceiving other's acts to/involving you)
Paraphrase 25:
> If any have offended against you, consider first: what is my relation to them? And that we are made for one another. And in another respect, I 
> was made to be set over them: as a ram over a flock or a bull over a herd.
> But examine the matter from first principles, from this:
> 1. If all things are not mere atoms, it is nature that orders all things. If this is so, then the inferior things exist for the
> sake of the superior. And these for the sake of one another.
> 2. Consider what kind of men they are at table, in bed and so forth. Consider how much they are in compulsion with respect to 
> their opinions and beliefs. And as for their acts, consider with what pride they do what they do.
> 3. That if men do rightly what they do, then we do not ought to be displeased. And that if they do not do right, then it is
> plain that they do so involuntarily and in ignorance. For every soul is unwillingly deprived of the truth, so also it is unwillingly
> deprived of the power of behaving to each man according to what he deserves. Accordingly, men are pained when they are called unjust, 
> ungrateful and greedy and in a word, wrongdoers to their neighbours.
> 4. Consider that you also do many things wrong and that you are a man who has faults. And if you do abstain from certian faults, 
> still you have the disposition though either through cowardice or concern for reputation or some such mean motive, you do abstain 
> from such faults.
> 5. Consider that you do not even understand whether men are doing wrong or not. For many things are done in reference to some context or
> circumstance and in short, a man must learn a great deal in order to pass a correct judgement on another's act.    
> 6. Consider when you are much vexed or grieved that man's life is only a moment. And after a short time, we are all laid out dead!
> 7. That it is not men's act that disturb us, for they have their foundations in men's ruling principles. But it is our own opinions which
> disturb us. Take away those opinions and resolve to dismiss your judgements about those acts as it they were something grievous and your
>  anger is gone. How can I then take away those opinions? By reflecting that no wrongful act of another brings shame on you. For if you allow
>  anything else to be more evil than those things that are shameful, you may fall into wrongdoing to avoid those evils and become a thief or
>  someone of a worse character to achieve your worldly aims.
>  8. Consider how much more pain is brought on us by the anger and vexation caused by such acts than the acts themselves.
>  9. (*Tit for Tat, with concessions*) Consider that a good disposition is invincible if it be genuine and not an affected 
>  smile or acting a part. For what will the most violent man do to you if you continue to be of a kind and respectful disposition to them.
>  And when the opportunity offers, you gently admonish him and calmly correct his errors each time he trying to cause you harm by saying, 
>  "Not so my child, we are constituted by nature to do something else. I will certainly not be injured but you are injuring yourself my child".
>  ... Do this without any double meaning and without a rancour in your soul. Not you are lecturing him. Nor yet that any bystander may be
>  impressed but aimed just for the man, even if others are present, in question.
>  
> **Remember these 9 rules, as if they were gift that you received from the muses and begin at last to be man while you live. You must equally
> avoid flattering men or be vexed at them, for doing both are unsocial and lead to harm. And let this truth be known to you at the time of anger:
> that to be moved by passion is not manly and that mildness and gentleness, as they are more agreeable to human nature, and so too are they more manly.**
> 
> And he who possesses these qualities, possesses strength, nerves and courage and not the man who is subject to fits of passion and discontent. For in the 
> same degree as man's mind is nearer to freedom from all passion, in the same degree, it is also nearer to strength. As the sense of pain is a characteristic
> of weakness, so also is anger. For he who yields to pain and he who yields to anger: both are wounded for both submit. 
> 
> And if you will, receive also a 10th present from the leader of the muses, Apollo, and it it this:
> 10. To expect bad men not to do bad is madness. For he who expects this, desires an impossibility. And to allow men to behave such to other men and not
> to expect them to do the same to you is irrational and tyrannical.

# Curated Excerpts from Meditations by Marcus Aurelius (the stoic philospher emperor of Rome circa 150 AD)

## (On bearing calamity like someone who makes their own good fortune)
Paraphrase 1:
> Remember too on every occasion that leads you to vexation, to apply this principle: 
> "Not that this is a misfortune, but that to bear it nobly is good fortune"

## (On travelling the maze of problems, paths and life)
Paraphrase 2:
> Always run the shortest way. For the shortest way is the most natural one. Always say and do everthing
> in conformity with the soundest reason for such a trouble frees a man from trouble and warfare and all
> artifice and ostentatious display.

## (On rising up in the morning when it is hard and a struggle)
Paraphrase 3:
> In the morning when you feel unwilling to rise, let this thought be present. I am rising to the work of a human being.
> Why then am I so dissatisfied to do the work for which I exist? For which I have been brought into the world. 
> Or have been made for this? To stay in the bed and keep myself warm? Do you exist for the sake of pleasure 
> rather than action or exertion? Do you not see the little plants, the bees, the animals, to put into order their 
> little corners the universe?
> So why are you unwilling to do the work of a human being? To do the things that which your very nature to do?
> It is necessary to take rest but nature has set bounds for these things like it has set bounds for eating and drinking.
> Yet you go astray of these bounds constantly through your actions.
> .
> .
> . All this goes to show that you do not love yourself. Because if you did, you would love nature and accept its ways.

## (On the perseverence and tenacity of the soul)
Paraphrase 4:
> Death is a relief from sense impressions. From the pulling of the strings that move the appetites. From the discursive
> movements of the thoughts and from service of the flesh. It is shameful for the soul to be first to give way in life.
> When your body has not given way. Care that you are made into a Caeser that succumbs to this affliction. That you are not
> dyed with this dye.

## (On distraction recovery)
Paraphrase 5:
> When circumstances drive you into some kind of disturbed state. Quickly return to yourself and do not continue out of tune
> longer than the compulsion lasts. For you will have more mastery over the harmony by continually recurring to it.
> .... not to be pulled about by desires like puppets on a string.

## (On sniffing out superficial falsehood/adulation)
Paraphrase 6:
> (... need to strip things of all the words with which they are exultated) For outward show is the most wonderful perverter
> of the *reason*. And when you are sure that you are most employed about the things that are worth doing. It is then that
> it cheats you most.... Most of the things that the multitudes admire are objects of the most general kind held together by
> some sort of cohesion e.g. natural organizations like vines, or fig trees. Those that are admired by men who are a little
> more reasonable are things that are held together by some living principle as flocks of birds. Those that are admired by men
>  that are still more instructed are things that are held together by a rational soul. Not a universal soul but a rational soul 
>  that is skilled in some art or expert in some other way. But one who values the rational nature of the soul, a soul fitted for
>  political life regards nothing else except this. And above all things, he keeps his soul in a condition and in an activity 
>  conformable to reason and political life  and cooperates with others who exist in this with him in cohesion.

## (On inner tranquility and envy/resentment of others)
Paraphrase 7:
> What then is to be valued? Not clapping of hands or tongues (praise from others). Suppose that you have given up this worthless
> thing called fame. What remains of value? It is in my opinion to move or to restraint yourself in conformity to your own constitution. 
> For in the end, this is where all employments or arts lead. For all art aims at this: that the thing that which is made should be
> adapted for which it has been made. For both the wine planter looks after the horse breeder and he who trains the dogs seeks this end. And what should
> be the aim of the education of the youth? So if this sense of true value has been established, you will not seek anything else. You will cease
> valuing a mass of other things as well. The alternative is not to be free nor sufficient in your own happiness or dispassionate. You will need
> to be envious and suspicious of others -- those who are capable of taking these things from you and plot against those who have that which you
> desire. Of necessity, man must be ever in a state of perturbation who ever needs these things. Besides which, he must also find fault with the gods. 
> But to reverence and honour your own mind will make you content and in harmony with society and in agreement with the gods. Praising all the order
> that have created...
 
## (On feeling about things not in your control)
Paraphrase 8:
> Whatever you should suppose to be good or evil in the things that are not in your control. It mustn't of necessity be that the bad thing 
> before you or the loss of a good thing that you blame the gods or hate men too who are the cause of this loss or suspected to be the cause of 
> this loss. And indeed we do much injustice in our need to make such links. But if we judge things, those that are within our power to be good
> or bad: there should be no reason to find fault with the gods or putting up a hostile attiude towards a man. 

## (On true good)
Paraphrase 9:
> What is your own good? He who loves fame considers his good to lie in another man's reactions. He who loves pleasure considers his good to lie his
> sensations. But he who has understanding considers his own acts to be his own good. It is in our power to have no opinions about things and not be
> disturbed in our souls. For things in themselves do not have the power to enter into our judgement. 

## (Universal goodness)
Paraphrase 10:
> That which is not good for the swarm, neither is it good for the bee... 

## (On recovering in life)
Paraphrase 11:
> To recover life, you must look at things like what you used to look at them before. 
> Every man is just as worth that with which he busies himself.

## (On unashamedly asking for help)
Paraphrase 12:
> Be not ashamed to be helped. For it is your job to do your duty like a soldier when there is an assault on the town. How then, 
> if being lame you cannot mount up on the battlements by yourself but with the help of another, it is possible.

## (On not letting future disturb you)
Paraphrase 13:
> Do not let future things disturb you. For you will come to them, if it will be necessary. Having with you same reasons that which you
> have at present.

## (On natural reasons)
Paraphrase 14:
> To the rational animal, an act that is according to nature is also an act according to reason. Be upright or be made upright.

## (On truly loving humanity)
Paraphrase 15:
> Just as it is with members of an organic or physical body, united in a single entity, so it is with rational beings that exist separately
> but have been brought together in a unified endeavour and the perception of this will be more apparent to you if you regularly say to
> yourself: "I am a member of a  single sysetm that is rational humanity." Do not say part for that shows that you do not love humanity from your heart. 
> Beneficience does not yet delight you for its own sake. You still do it for the sake of duty. And not out of a concern for your own true welfare.

## (On tolerable pain)
Paraphrase 16:
> The pain which is intolerable carries us off. But the pain that lasts a long time is tolerable. And mind maintains its own tranquility by retiring
> into itself. And the ruling faculty (thinking ability, your reasoning mind) is not itself damaged by pain. As for the parts which are harmed by pain, 
> let them offer their opinion if they can.
